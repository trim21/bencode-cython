A simple project file structure to quickly ramp-up a new Cython project.

## Contribute
Let's work to make it as easy as possible for folks to create new Cython-based projects.
Pull-Requests, Issues, and Feedback are all welcome on the project's [GitHub Page](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CythonProjectTemplate)

## Change Right Away
- Update the `LICENSE.md` to match your project's needs.
- Update `pyproject.toml` with your project & author information, dependencies, etc.
- Update `.coveragerc` with your project name.
- It is recommended you remove all files from `Tests\` and `CythonProjectTemplate\` directories (except the top-level `__init__.py`) after you have reviewed them.
- Change the directory `CythonProjectTemplate` to match the name of your package.
- Search for `"#! Update"` in all files to find critical locations that need to be changed for your specific project.
- Read through `.github\workflows\build_wheels_main_pypi.yml` and make the necessary changes.
- `.gitignore` was configured with Cython, Python, C, C++, in mind. Also it has VSCode IDE specific file ignores. You may need to edit for your needs.

## Developing Your Project
- Whenever you create a new cython pyx/pxd file make sure to add it to the `cython_extensions.json` file otherwise it will not be compiled when your project is installed.

### Getting Your Project on PyPI
- Come up with a unique name (search [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) to ensure it is not already taken).
- Follow the instructions [here](). Since you used this template you can skip down to step 8!
- After the initial upload you can automate the process.
    - Get your [PyPI API token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken).
    - Add it to your [secret environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) on your project's GitHub repository.
    - Have the pre-built `.github\workflows\build_wheels_main_pypi.yml` do all the hard work when you release a new version on GitHub.
